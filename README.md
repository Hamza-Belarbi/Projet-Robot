# ü§ñ Mobile Robot Controlled via STM32 and Android App

## üìò Project Overview

This project implements the control of a **mobile robot** using an **STM32 microcontroller** and an **Android application** via Bluetooth (HC-05).  
The robot can move **forward**, **rotate right by 45¬∞** or **rotate continuously to the right**, either as a short rotation or continuously while the command is active. 

All motion commands are executed with **PWM motor control**, **GPIO-based direction**, and **timer-based rotation** for accurate, non-blocking control.

> üè´ This project was carried out as part of the **"Conception des Syst√®mes √âlectroniques 1"** course at **l'√âcole des Mines de Saint-√âtienne**.

## üß© Hardware Overview

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| MCU | STM32L476RG (Nucleo-L476RG board) |
| Motors | 2x DC motors with L298N driver |
| Bluetooth | Bluetooth 2.0 module (HC-05) for communication with Android phone |
| Power | Ni-Mh or Ni-Cd battery, rechargeable via 11‚ÄØV supply. Fully charged ~8‚ÄØV, considered discharged at ~6‚ÄØV (test point 7.2‚ÄØV). 8‚ÄØV powers DC motors, 6‚ÄØV for servo, and regulated 3.3‚ÄØV for Nucleo board. |

## üì° Communication Protocol

Commands received from Android via UART:

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `'F'` | Move forward at 20 cm/s |
| `'R'` | Rotate right (short: +45¬∞; continuous while pressed) |
| `'S'` | Stop immediately |
